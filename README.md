## .env 
- Create a .env file in the root directory, this will contain application secrets and info, the following items are needed in the .env file
- MONGODB_URL
    - Get the mongodb url by going to clusters in mongodb, then choose to connect to application, a link will be generated that looks something like this:
        - ```mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.is8bq.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority``` 
        - replace < password > with the password you had set for that user
        - replace < dbname > with the database name you want 
- ACTIVATION_TOKEN_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET
    - Token secrets used for generating the JWT for auth. It's recommended to use a seperate randomized password for each of these secrets.
